This repository includes the results on the analysis of the single-cell RNA seq data in ovarian cancer. 
There is a pdf readable script "final_pipeline_with_embeded_figures.pdf" that includes information about the workflow and 
the explanations for chosen parameters in the analysis. Please download to open.
3D trajectories file is reported in HTML format, therefore please do not open 'raw view' in the browser.
Please download the files locally before openning them.
Apart from the technical script, there are also PPT slides with background information and final results that I presented at the end of the internship.
